# Gantry

A graphical interface for managing Docker.

My daily driver is a Linux machine and I use docker-ce rather than Docker Desktop. I've had too many issues with
Docker Desktop on Linux. However, I do like the graphical environment.

The inital goal for this project is to be a simple GUI for managine docker as part of my local development environment.
Maybe someday in the future it will be more. ;)
