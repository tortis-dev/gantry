# Gantry

<img src="gantry.png" width="200px" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;" />

A graphical interface for managing Docker.

My daily driver is a Linux machine, and I use docker-ce rather than Docker Desktop. I've had too many issues with
Docker Desktop on Linux. However, I do like the graphical environment.

The initial goal for this project is to be a simple GUI for managing docker as part of my local development environment.
Maybe someday in the future it will be more. ;)
